WHERE YA BEEN

A contact tracing app that allows businesses to log the comings and going of their customers and employees and safely notify customers that they shared space with a potentially infectious person. Contact tracing can be stressful and difficult. Where Ya Been aims to make it a bit easier.

Simply choose your business from the select page then begin logging the names, phone numbers, and emails of your customers as they visit your business. Checking customers out is as easy as clicking a button. 

A report for a positive covid test can be made on the report page. Simply choose a name from the drop down list, enter the date on which the positive test was administered, then hit submit report - a list of customers that shared space with the potentially infectious person will be generated with their contact info and date(s) of overlapping visit.

Thanks!
